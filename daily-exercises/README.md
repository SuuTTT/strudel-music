- **Syntax**: Advanced pattern manipulation and transformations
- **Composition**: Harmonic progressions and song structure

### Week 3: Rhythm & Dynamics
- **Theory**: Rhythm patterns, polyrhythms, and dynamics
- **Syntax**: Effects, filters, and sound design
- **Composition**: Complex rhythmic compositions

### Week 4: Advanced Techniques
- **Theory**: Modes, advanced harmony, and form analysis
- **Syntax**: Complex pattern combinations and live coding
- **Composition**: Full composition projects

## How to Use These Exercises

1. **Start with Week 1** - Build a solid foundation
2. **Practice daily** - Each exercise is designed for 15-30 minutes
3. **Experiment** - Modify examples to understand concepts deeply
4. **Listen actively** - Pay attention to how code translates to music
5. **Build gradually** - Each week builds on previous knowledge

## Tips for Success

- **Listen before coding** - Understand the music you want to create
- **Start simple** - Master basics before moving to complex patterns
- **Experiment freely** - Don't be afraid to break things
- **Document progress** - Keep notes on what you learn
- **Share creations** - Music is meant to be shared!
